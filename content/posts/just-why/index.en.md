*I think it's never too late to start doing something.
In this little post I want to try to describe my "elephant".
It's a starting point that starts a long journey.*

As a developer I have 2 main needs: Projects and Curiosity. Let's talk about them.

# Projects

## What's bedware
It's simple. It's me. A software developer with over 7 years of commercial development experience.

## What I put in bedware software
This is the part of my life that is IT related and means to me:

0. Software
1. Project 
2. Community of like-minded people
3. Author
4. Company
5. Public resource (blog, telegram channel, ...)

## Philosophy of projects
After gaining experience, it became clear that projects are the main thing in development, as they ultimately feed everyone.
I agree with many developers that it is important to do projects. I'm sure you've heard that out of 10 projects only 2 will be successful.
So let's just do them) Can't do it yourself? Come with me!

## Principles
- Project first
- Real material (you can use outside sources, but you have to digest it)
- Don't cancel anyone
- No bad words

# Curiosity and what to do with it

## I love learning and helping others
From the very beginning, I remember nights on end being able to learn a technology that interested me. And as time went on, I started to help and help others learn.
This is very important to me. I'm going to use the community to the fullest to learn with you!


I am interested in getting feedback. I chose a format that makes it easy to share. Share it with me :)


I hope here we can create a community that wants to change the world through apps and code.

## List of topics I will be covering
- Interview preparation
    - Algorithms
    - System Design
- English
- Computer Science
- Development
    - Languages
    - Databases
    - Testing
- Developer productivity
- Developers' joy
